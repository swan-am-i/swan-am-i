## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Priya Aswani. I work at Microsoft in the Machine Learning Space. 

I have had experience as a Data Science Architect working on Reinforcement Learning projects applied to horizontal drilling, computer vision modeling applied to decoking extraction, crack spread forecasting, predictive maintenance and remote monitoring solutions applied in Manufacturing.

Now-a-days I work on GenAI LLMs having released 3 copilots at Microsoft for Co-Analyst, [Science Engine Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-s/?msockid=165c50546016693028c9458864166bdf) and [Partner Center Co-pilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/ai-assistant-overview). I was an AI Architect and then an IoT Architect, until I found the nexus of all 3 fields (AI, IoT and Robotics) in Mixed Reality.

Core Skills:
Machine Learning, DNN, CNN, RL, MLOps, LLMOps, Statistics, Simulation & Synthetics, Robotics, Mixed Reality, Unreal Engine, NVIDIA Omniverse, Cloud Infrastructure, AI systems, Game Engine Archtecture, Performance Optimization, Data Pipelines, Synthetic Dataset Generation.

I graduated to a Primcipal SWE in the Mixed Reality Environmental Understanding Data Team where I worked on Data Science informing the investments in Mixed Reality. My work bridged high - performance simulation, robotics, AI and game engine technology to accelerate Mixed Reality and robitics research through synthetic datasets and parallelized compute pipelines.

I worked on:
1) Robotics that racked and stacked servers at the Microsoft Data Centers using spatial intelligence and computer vison.
2) Synthetic Data Systems Design: Scaling Simulation and synthetic data generation through cloud - native infrastructure and advanced rendering systems. Built scalable pipelines for generating synthetic ground truth data across multiple Mixed Reality projects. Enabled Experimemtation at scale bu authoring representative 3D scenes and custom simulation scenarios. Initiated and built foundational simulation and synthetics pipeline to address data scalability limitations. Parallelized execution across Microsoft's cloud infrastructure tto meet experimental demand while validating simulation accuracy with domain experts.
3) Cloud Simulation Architecture Optimization: Redesigned the parallelized simulation and rendering pipeline to reduce compute time and operational costs, while maintaining the fidelity and reliability of the synthetic data.
4) Sensor and Environment Modeling: I augmented support for advanced sensor models and implemented new simulation features - including annimated occluders and dynamic environments - to enhance realism and experimental coverage.
5) Omniverse Scenario Editing Platform: Designed and implemented a modular scenario editor in NVIDIA Omniverse, creating 50+ Reusable extensions to support rapid authoring of experiments prior to large scale cloud simulations. The extensions have been adopted across multiple research teams for custom scenario creation.
6) Surface Reconstruction and Mapping Service: Led backend development for real time surface reconstruction, localization, and object recognition services used by Mixed Reailty Teams. Deliivered a reliable, performant service integrated across internal pipelines
7) [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/enabling-interaction-between-mixed-reality-and-robots-via-cloud-based-localization/) and azure object anchors products: I led 2 products focused on alignment of the virtual and physical world and the respective computer vision model accuracy.  I used 3D point clouds, SLAM alogorithms and 3D reconstruction.
